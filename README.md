# Hello, I am Geno (Real Name: Andrew), a 12yr old kid from Romania that loves coding. I've been coding since I was 8, and in the last 2 years, i have learnt how to make hacks/cheats/mods for android unity games!
##Accomplishments include but are not limited to:
 - Geno Mods v1
 - Geno Mods v2
 - Geno Mods v3
 - Cracking LGL Login in 30 seconds
 - Getting noticed by a famous modder (And become friends with him)

I mainly help people with problems they might occur in the future and give out modding sources
